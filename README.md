Hybrid Multi-task learning for A3C (CNN+LSTM)(SpaceInvaders and DemonAttack)

This is my first python Ai project, two game environments are training global network with the number worker.
In this example, I used to four workers for each games and they are SpaceInvaders and DemonAttack.
Firstly, you need to install tensorflow 2 and above python 3.5 
after done install gym (OpenAI) library (pip install gym[all]), numpy, pandas ,etc
If you think there has error, you can remind me on the command section
